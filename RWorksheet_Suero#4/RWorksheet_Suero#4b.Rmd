```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



1.Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1.

It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.


```{r}
vectorA <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

matrix_A <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

for (j in 1:5)
  for (k in 1:5)
  {
    matrix_A[j, k] <- abs(vectorA[j] - vectorA[k])
  }

matrix_A
```


2.Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown
in Figure 2.

```{r}
for (j in 1:5) {
  cat(paste0("\"", rep("*", j), "\""), "\n")
}


```
 
3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input
up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output
```{r}
userInput <- as.integer(readline("Enter starting number for Fibonacci sequence: "))

if(is.na(userInput || userInput < 0)) {
  cat("Please enter something")
} else {
  x <- userInput
  y <- 0
  
  
cat("Fibonacci sequence starting from", userInput, ":\n")

repeat {
  
  next_num <- x + y
  
  if (next_num > 500){
    break
  }
  cat(next_num, " ")
  x <- y
  y <- next_num
  
}
}

```
4. Import the dataset as shown in Figure 1 you have created previously.

4a. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of the dataset? 
Show your codes and its result.

```{r HOUSEHOLD_DATA, echo = TRUE}

imported<- read.csv("householdData.csv")
head(imported)
```
4b. Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in
Male? How about in Female? 
Write the R scripts and its output.

```{r}
males <- imported[imported$Gender == "M",]
males

females <- imported[imported$Gender == "F",]
females

numofMale <- nrow(males)
numofMale

numofFem <- nrow(females)
numofFem


```

4c. Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(), chart type = barplot. Make sure to place title, legends, and colors.  Write the R scripts and its result

```{r}
totalMaleFemale <- table(imported$Gender)
barplot(totalMaleFemale,
        main = "Number of Males and Females",
        xlab = "Gender",
        ylab = "Count",
        col = c("green", "purple"),
        legend.text = rownames(totalMaleFemale),
        beside = TRUE)


```


5.The monthly income of Dela Cruz family was spent on the following:

```{r}

spending_data <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Food", "Electricity", "Savings", "Miscellaneous"),
  Value = c(60, 10, 5, 25)
)

spending_data$Percentage <- spending_data$Value / sum(spending_data$Value) * 100

colors <- c("blue", "red", "yellow", "black")

pie(spending_data$Value,
    labels = paste(spending_data$Category, "(",spending_data$Percentage,"%)"),
    col = colors,
    main = "Monthly Income Spending of Dela Cruz Family")

legend("topright", spending_data$Category, fill = colors)



```




6a. Check for the structure of the data set using the str() function. Describe what you have seen in the output.

```{r}
data(iris)
str(iris)

#The dataset comprises details on iris flowers, encompassing measurements of sepal length and width, as well as petal length and width for 150 distinct iris flowers. Additionally, it includes information on the iris species to which each flower belongs, categorizing them into three types: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
```
6b.Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length,
sepal.width,petal.length,and petal.width. What is the R script and its result?
```{r}
meanIris <- c(mean(iris$Sepal.Length), mean(iris$Sepal.Width), mean(iris$Petal.Length), mean(iris$Petal.Width))
meanIris




meanSepalLength <- mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
meanSepalWidth <- mean(iris$Sepal.Width)
meanPetalLength <- mean(iris$Petal.Length)
meanPetalWidth <- mean(iris$Petal.Width)

meanIris <- data.frame(Sepal_Length = meanSepalLength,
                        Sepal_Width = meanSepalWidth,
                        Petal_Length = meanPetalLength,
                        Petal_Width = meanPetalWidth)
meanIris

```
6c. Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors. Write
the R script and its result.

```{r}
species_count <- table(iris$Species)
name_of_Species <- c("Setosa", "Versicolor", "Virginica")
pie(species_count,
    labels = name_of_Species,
    col = c("purple", "yellow", "green"),
    main = "Species Distribution in Iris Dataset")

legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species), fill = c("purple", "yellow", "green"),)
```


6d. Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Write the R scripts
and show the last six (6) rows of each species.

```{r}
setosaSubset <- subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
versicolorSubset <- subset(iris, Species == "versicolor")
virginicaSubset <- subset(iris, Species == "virginica")


tail(setosaSubset, 6)
tail(versicolorSubset, 6)
tail(virginicaSubset, 6)
```
6e. Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the different
species(setosa,versicolor,virginica). Add a title = “Iris Dataset”, subtitle = “Sepal
width and length, labels for the x and y axis, the pch symbol and colors should be based on
the species.

```{r}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,
     xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Sepal Width",
     main = "Iris Dataset", sub = "Sepal width and length",
     pch = as.numeric(iris$Species), col = as.numeric(iris$Species))
legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species), col = 1:3, pch = 1:3, cex = 0.8, title = "Species")

```

6f.  Interpret the result.

  The dataset is structured as a data frame with 150 rows and five columns. The four numerical variables, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Sepal.Length, and
Sepal.Width, represent measurements of petal and sepal dimensions. Additionally, there's a factor variable called Species, indicating the species of iris flowers with three categories: "setosa," "versicolor," and "virginica." These categories distinguish different types of iris flowers in the dataset.


7. Import the alexa-file.xlsx. Check on the variations. Notice that there are extra whitespaces among black variants (Black Dot, Black Plus, Black Show, Black Spot). Also on the white variants (White Dot, White Plus, White Show, White Spot).


```{r}
library(readxl)
alexa<- read_excel("alexa_file.xlsx")
file_path <- "/cloud/project/RWorksheet_Suero#4.xlsx"
alexa

```

7a. Rename the white and black variants by using gsub() function.
```{r}

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Dot", 
                             "BlackDot",
                             alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Plus",
                             "BlackPlus", 
                             alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Show", 
                             "BlackShow", 
                             alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Spot", 
                             "BlackSpot",
                             alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Dot",
                             "WhiteDot",
                             alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Plus",
                             "WhitePlus", 
                             alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Show",
                             "WhiteShow",
                             alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Spot",
                             "WhiteSpot",
                             alexa$variation)

alexa
```

7b. Get the total number of each variations and save it into another object. Save the object as variations.RData. Write the R scripts. What is its result?

Hint: Use the dplyr package. Make sure to install it before loading the package.

```{r}
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

variationsTotal <- alexa %>% 
  count(alexa$variation)

variationsTotal
save(variationsTotal, file = "variations.RData")

```
7c. From the variations.RData, create a barplot(). Complete the details of the chart
which include the title, color, labels of each bar.

```{r}
load("variations.RData")
variationsTotal
varNames <- variationsTotal$`alexa$variation`

totalPlot <- barplot(variationsTotal$n,
        names.arg = varNames,
        main = "Total number of each variation",
        xlab = "Name of Variations",
        ylab = "Total of each Variation",
        col = 1:16,
        space = 0.1,
        cex.names = 0.5,
        las = 2)
png("/cloud/project/RWorksheet_Suero#4/variationsTotal.png", width = 800, height = 600, units = "px", pointsize = 12)
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/RWorksheet_Suero#4/variationsTotal.png")

```
7d. Create a barplot() for the black and white variations. Plot it in 1 frame, side by
side. Complete the details of the chart.
```{r}
blackVars <- variationsTotal[variationsTotal$`alexa$variation` %in% c("Black", "BlackPlus", "BlackShow", "BlackSpot", "BlackDot"), ]
whiteVars <- variationsTotal[variationsTotal$`alexa$variation` %in% c("White", "WhiteDot", "WhitePlus", "WhiteShow", "WhiteSpot"), ]

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

blackPlot <- barplot(height = blackVars$n,
                     names.arg = blackVars$`alexa$variation`,
                     col = c("blue"),
                     main = "Black Variations",
                     xlab = "Variation",
                     ylab = "Count",
                     border = "black",
                     space = 0.5,
                     cex.names = 0.4)
png("/cloud/project/RWorksheet_Suero#4/blackVars.png", width = 800, height = 400, units = "px", pointsize = 12)
png("/cloud/project/RWorksheet_Suero#4/whiteVars.png", width = 800, height = 400, units = "px", pointsize = 12)


knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/RWorksheet_Suero#4/blackVars.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/RWorksheet_Suero#4/whiteVars.png")


```
